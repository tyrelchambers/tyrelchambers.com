                When I graduated from college with a Law and Security
                Administration diploma, I wanted to go back to school for a
                better degree. My original plan was to go to university for
                Computer Hardware Engineering, but while getting a few missing
                high-school courses, I stumbled upon web development. I ditched
                my plans for university and pursued this career for the last 8-9
                years.

                My career began working as a security guard for about 9 months;
                it was probably the worst experience in my life ðŸ˜†. I then moved
                into retail as a cashier at a sporting-goods store. After about
                4 years I went into IT as a support rep in elementary schools
                for the schoolboard here. I learned a lot in that job and was
                happy to be near tech. After 2.5 years I finally fell into the
                career I've been working toward in 2021.

                The video here shows me and my cousin walking across the longest
                foot suspension bridge in Canada (about 700 feet long). It was
                incredibly windy up at that height (about 150 meters), but it
                was an amazing experience.
