                When I graduated from college with a Law and Security
                Administration diploma, I wanted to go back to school for a
                better degree. My original plan was to go to university for
                Computer Hardware Engineering, but while getting a few missing
                high-school courses, I stumbled upon web development. I ditched
                my plans for university and pursued this career for the last 8-9
                years.

              <p className="text-gray-400 leading-loose">
                My career began working as a security guard for about 9 months;
                it was probably the worst experience in my life ðŸ˜†. I then moved
                into retail as a cashier at a sporting-goods store. After about
                4 years I went into IT as a support rep in elementary schools
                for the schoolboard here. I learned a lot in that job and was
                happy to be near tech. After 2.5 years I finally fell into the
                career I've been working toward in 2021.
